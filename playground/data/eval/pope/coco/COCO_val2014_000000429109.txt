The photograph shows a bustling city street with several buses and a van. The buses are of varying sizes and colors, including red, green, and white. One of the buses is labeled "MTS," which is likely the name of the public transportation service. The street is lined with palm trees and buildings, and there are several people on the scene, including a man standing near one of the buses and a cyclist riding past. A parking sign is visible in the foreground, and the overall atmosphere suggests a busy urban environment.
